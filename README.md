# üß† Pineapple Lab OS Docs

Welcome to **Pineapple Lab OS Docs** ‚Äî the definitive open-source resource for advanced prompt engineering, context engineering, and AI agent design.

This repository shares Pineapple Labs' research, methodologies, and practical frameworks for building reliable, production-ready AI systems. From beginner-friendly introductions to advanced reasoning frameworks, we provide comprehensive, research-backed guidance for engineering AI behavior.

> üß™ **I'm David Edwards.** This repo is where I collect findings, test ideas, and publish what works ‚Äî and what doesn't ‚Äî in building composable, safe, and production-minded AI agents.

You're welcome to fork, clone, copy, remix, and apply this material to your engineering teams, research work, or agent runtime stacks.

**Contributions, feedback, and wild ideas are all welcome ‚Äî this is a lab, not a product.**

## üåç Purpose

This repo is part of the **Pineapple Lab OS** ‚Äî a growing open-source hub for publishing Pineapple Labs' research, tooling, and findings around AI systems.

At its core, Pineapple Lab OS is about **building a public R&D hub for the AI community**. The documents and blueprints here are based on real experiments, systems design efforts, and exploratory research. We believe in transparent collaboration and open sourcing not just code, but thinking.

### This Project Exists To:

- üìö Publish **tested, reusable prompting patterns** for GPT, Claude, DeepSeek, and Gemini
- üèóÔ∏è Develop a **modular design system** for sophisticated AI agent behavior
- üî¨ Share **research-backed methodologies** for improving AI reliability and honesty
- ü§ù Invite **open-source contributions** from fellow builders and researchers
- üöÄ Advance the **state of the art** in prompt engineering and context engineering

This is not a static spec ‚Äî it's an **evolving playbook** for how we build LLM systems, and an open call for collaboration.

## üî¨ Research Methodologies

### **Core Framework: Seven-Component Blueprint**

Our [Prompt Engineering Blueprint](Prompt_Engineering_Blueprint.md) provides a complete framework:

1. **System Declaration** (Agent Role Definition) + XML `<role>` tags
2. **Instruction Block** with clear task separation + XML `<instructions>` tags
3. **Logic Block** enhanced with CoT and conditional logic + XML `<reasoning>` tags
4. **Input/Output Separation** using XML structural tags
5. **Output Formatting & Constraints** with XML `<format>` and `<constraints>` tags
6. **Few-Shot Examples** organized with XML `<examples>` tags
7. **Evaluation & Escape Hatches** with validation frameworks

**Each component integrates Truth Optimization principles throughout.**
