## üî¨ Core Frameworks

### **Seven-Component Blueprint**

The [Prompt Engineering Blueprint](Prompt_Engineering_Blueprint.md) I've organized provides a systematic framework based on best practices from multiple sources:

1. **System Declaration** (Agent Role Definition) + XML `<role>` tags
2. **Instruction Block** with clear task separation + XML `<instructions>` tags
3. **Logic Block** enhanced with CoT and conditional logic + XML `<reasoning>` tags
4. **Input/Output Separation** using XML structural tags
5. **Output Formatting & Constraints** with XML `<format>` and `<constraints>` tags
6. **Few-Shot Examples** organized with XML `<examples>` tags
7. **Evaluation & Escape Hatches** with validation frameworks

**Each component integrates Truth Optimization principles throughout.**

---

### **Truth Optimization Engine (TOE)**

A systematic framework for encouraging AI honesty and reliability:

**What it is:** A collection of prompt engineering techniques that encourage models to express uncertainty, state assumptions, and acknowledge limitations. This builds on AI safety research, model calibration work (Guo et al., 2017), and standard software documentation practices.

**Core Techniques:**
- **Explicit Uncertainty Acknowledgment**: `[CONFIDENT]`, `[LIKELY]`, `[UNCERTAIN]` markers
- **Assumption Transparency**: Making AI assumptions explicit
- **Limitation Disclosure**: Honest about what AI can't do
- **Honest Reporting Framework**: Structured honesty in responses
- **Validation Requirements**: Built-in self-checking mechanisms

**Where it comes from:** I've synthesized these techniques from AI safety research, Anthropic's work on AI honesty, and standard software practices. My contribution is organizing them into a coherent framework and providing practical examples.

**Real-world testing:** In my experience building AI agents for Pineapple Lab products, these structured approaches have significantly reduced instances where AI generates non-functional code or makes overconfident claims. I haven't conducted formal benchmarking yet, so I can't provide quantitative metrics.

## üß¨ A Note from David

Hey, I'm David Edwards. I'm 21, living in South Africa, and building AI products like RITA and OS Brick at Pineapple Lab.

**Here's the honest truth:** I'm not a PhD researcher or an AI scientist. I'm a builder who loves to learn. When I started with prompt engineering, I spent months reading scattered docs from Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. I studied papers by Wei, Kojima, and others. It was overwhelming.

This repo is what I wish existed when I started: everything organized, practical examples from real projects, and a clear path from "complete beginner" to "building production systems."

**What makes this valuable:**
- **Starting Guide** ‚Äî I distilled months of learning into 30 minutes
- **XML Tag Structuring** ‚Äî Anthropic's technique with my real-world examples
- **Advanced Logic Building** ‚Äî Wei & Kojima's research applied to actual products
- **Truth Optimization Engine** ‚Äî My framework for AI honesty, synthesized from multiple sources

**I didn't invent these techniques.** But I've tested them for hundreds of hours, organized them coherently, and documented what actually works in production.

**Why I'm sharing:** I believe in learning in public. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants and documenting the climb so you don't have to figure it all out alone like I did.

**Feedback is gold:** If you spot errors, have suggestions, or discover better patterns ‚Äî please contribute. I'm learning too, and honest corrections make this better for everyone.

Thanks for being curious and learning with me,

**‚Äì David Edwards**  
*21-year-old builder, learning in public*  
*Pineapple Lab, South Africa*
