# 🧠 Pineapple Lab OS Docs

Welcome to the Pineapple Lab OS Docs — an open-source GitHub repository designed to share Pineapple Labs' white papers, internal documentation, and community-facing research in the AI systems space.

This includes our first public release: the **Prompt Engineering Blueprint**, a practical guide to LLM behavior design, structured reasoning, and modular prompt workflows.

> 🧪 I’m David Edwards. This repo is where I collect findings, test ideas, and publish what works — and what doesn't — in building composable, safe, and production-minded AI agents.

You're welcome to fork, clone, copy, remix, and apply this material to your engineering teams, research work, or agent runtime stacks.

Contributions, feedback, and wild ideas are all welcome — this is a lab, not a product.

Welcome to Pineapple Labs' **Prompt Engineering Blueprint** — a living document and open research effort exploring new techniques in LLM prompt design, AI agent structuring, and modular memory-bound workflows.

> 🧪 This repo is my lab notebook. I’m David Edwards, and this is where I capture, refine, and share what I’m learning in the AI engineering space — especially around language model behavior and prompt-driven control systems.

## 🌍 Purpose

This repo is part of the **Pineapple Lab OS Docs** — a growing open-source GitHub space for publishing Pineapple Labs' research, tooling, and findings around AI systems.

At its core, Pineapple Lab OS is about building a public R\&D hub for the AI community. The documents and blueprints here are based on real experiments, systems design efforts, and exploratory research. We believe in transparent collaboration and open sourcing not just code, but thinking.

This project specifically focuses on:

This project exists to:

* Publish **tested, reusable prompting patterns** for GPT, Claude, and DeepSeek
* Develop a **modular design system** for niche AI agent behavior
* Share Pineapple Labs research findings publicly
* Invite open-source contributions from fellow builders

This is not a static spec — it’s an evolving playbook for how I build LLM systems, and an open call for collaboration.

## 🔧 Quickstart

1. Clone this repo
2. Read the [Prompting Blueprint Guide](./Prompting_Blueprint_Guide.md)
3. Copy a blueprint and start prototyping your prompt
4. Test in Claude, GPT-4, or DeepSeek
5. Refine and (optionally) submit back to the project

---

## 🧠 Design Principles

* **Clarity first** — every prompt block is modular and intentional
* **Structure > Style** — we treat prompts like functions, not text
* **Security-aware** — special attention to injection risks and ambiguity
* **Multi-model** — designed for Claude, GPT, DeepSeek from the start
* **Open Research** — Pineapple Labs is an open-source-first R\&D space

---

## 🧱 In Progress

* `prompt_registry.json` — structured schema for prompts-as-code
* `tests/` — prompt regression + consistency tests
* `agent_templates/` — blueprints for repeatable, role-specific GPTs
* `whitepaper.md` — outlining Pineapple Labs' approach to modular agents

---

## 🧬 A Note from Me

This project is the backbone of how I build AI agents for products like OS Brick. Whether you're exploring prompt chaining, ReAct logic, memory containerization, or persona design — this repo is yours to explore, extend, and question.

Thanks for being curious,

**– David Edwards / Pineapple Labs**
