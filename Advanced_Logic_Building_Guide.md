# Advanced Logic Building and Reasoning Frameworks

## 🧠 Introduction to Advanced Logic Building

Advanced logic building in prompt engineering extends beyond simple conditional statements to create sophisticated reasoning frameworks that guide language models through complex problem-solving processes. This methodology combines chain-of-thought reasoning, conditional logic, and structured decision-making to achieve more reliable and sophisticated AI outputs.

**Core Principle**: By explicitly structuring the reasoning process and providing clear logical pathways, we can significantly improve model performance on complex tasks requiring multi-step analysis, decision-making, and problem-solving.

**Referenced from**: [Prompt Engineering Blueprint](Prompt_Engineering_Blueprint.md) - This guide provides detailed implementation of advanced logic techniques that enhance the Logic Block component of the Blueprint.

## 🔗 Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

### Understanding Chain-of-Thought

Chain-of-Thought prompting is a technique that encourages language models to break down complex problems into intermediate reasoning steps, making the thought process explicit and improving accuracy on reasoning tasks.

**Research Foundation**: Introduced by Wei et al. (2022), CoT prompting has been shown to significantly improve performance on arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks, particularly with larger language models (65B+ parameters).

**Key Insight**: Making reasoning explicit improves both accuracy and debuggability.

### Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought

The simplest implementation involves adding "Let's think step by step" or similar prompting:

**Basic Example:**
```
Problem: A store has 15 apples. They sell 6 apples in the morning and 4 apples in the afternoon. How many apples are left?

Let's think step by step:
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Let me work through this step by step:
1. The store starts with 15 apples
2. They sell 6 apples in the morning: 15 - 6 = 9 apples remaining
3. They sell 4 apples in the afternoon: 9 - 4 = 5 apples remaining
4. Therefore, 5 apples are left at the end of the day.

Final Answer: 5 apples
```

### Advanced Zero-Shot CoT with XML Structure

**Professional Implementation:**
```xml
<role>
You are a business analyst solving operational efficiency problems.
</role>

<problem>
Our customer support team handles 500 tickets per day. Each ticket takes an average of 15 minutes to resolve. We have 5 support agents working 8-hour shifts. Are we adequately staffed?
</problem>

<instructions>
Solve this step-by-step. Show your reasoning process explicitly.
Use [CONFIDENT] markers for calculations and [ASSUMPTION] markers for any assumptions you make.
</instructions>

<reasoning_framework>
1. Calculate total time required to handle all tickets
2. Calculate total available agent hours
3. Compare capacity vs. demand
4. Account for breaks, meetings, and inefficiencies
5. Provide staffing recommendation with confidence level
</reasoning_framework>
```

**Expected Response:**
```xml
<step_by_step_reasoning>
<step number="1">
Calculate total time required:
- 500 tickets × 15 minutes = 7,500 minutes = 125 hours per day
[CONFIDENT] This is straightforward multiplication
</step>

<step number="2">
Calculate available agent hours:
- 5 agents × 8 hours = 40 hours per day
[CONFIDENT] Basic capacity calculation
</step>

<step number="3">
Compare capacity vs. demand:
- Need: 125 hours
- Have: 40 hours
- Shortfall: 85 hours (68% understaffed)
[CONFIDENT] Clear capacity gap
</step>

<step number="4">
Account for realistic factors:
[ASSUMPTION] Assuming agents are not 100% productive due to:
- Breaks (10% time)
- Team meetings (5% time)  
- Administrative tasks (10% time)
- Realistic productivity: 75% of shift

Adjusted capacity: 40 hours × 0.75 = 30 effective hours
Adjusted shortfall: 125 - 30 = 95 hours (76% understaffed)
[LIKELY] These percentages are industry-typical but should be verified for your organization
</step>

<step number="5">
Staffing recommendation:
- Required agents: 125 hours ÷ (8 hours × 0.75 efficiency) = 20.8 agents
- Recommended: 21 agents (rounding up for buffer)
- Current: 5 agents
- Need to hire: 16 additional agents

[CONFIDENT] The math is clear, but recommendation assumes:
- Current ticket volume is sustainable demand (not temporary spike)
- 15-minute average resolution time is accurate
- 8-hour shifts continue

[UNCERTAIN] Whether hiring is the best solution vs:
- Improving efficiency (reducing 15-min average)
- Implementing self-service options
- Redistributing ticket types
</step>
</step_by_step_reasoning>

<final_recommendation>
You are significantly understaffed. Immediate actions needed:
1. [SHORT TERM] Hire 10-12 agents immediately to reduce critical backlog
2. [MEDIUM TERM] Analyze ticket types for automation opportunities
3. [LONG TERM] Implement self-service knowledge base to reduce ticket volume

[CONFIDENT] on the capacity analysis
[LIKELY] on the recommended phased approach
</final_recommendation>
```

### Few-Shot Chain-of-Thought

Provide examples that demonstrate the reasoning process:

```xml
<role>
You are a financial advisor helping clients make investment decisions.
</role>

<instructions>
Analyze investment options and provide recommendations using step-by-step reasoning.
Learn from the example, then apply to the new case.
</instructions>

<example>
<client_scenario>
Client: 28 years old, $50K annual income, $10K to invest, moderate risk tolerance, 35-year time horizon
Options: High-yield savings (2% return), Index funds (8% avg return), Individual stocks (15% potential, high risk)
</client_scenario>

<reasoning>
Let me think through this systematically:

1. Time horizon analysis:
   - 35 years is long-term, allows recovery from market volatility
   - This favors growth-oriented investments
   [CONFIDENT] Long time horizon reduces risk of equity investments

2. Risk tolerance assessment:
   - "Moderate risk" suggests balance between growth and stability
   - Should avoid highest-risk options (individual stocks)
   - Should avoid lowest-return options (savings account for entire amount)
   [CONFIDENT] Client profile matches diversified approach

3. Calculate potential outcomes:
   - High-yield savings: $10K at 2% for 35 years = $20K (inflation-adjusted: likely negative real return)
   - Index funds: $10K at 8% for 35 years = $147K
   - Individual stocks: Too risky for entire portfolio
   [CONFIDENT] on calculations, [ASSUMPTION] on sustained 8% return

4. Consider diversification:
   - Emergency fund: Should client keep $5K in high-yield savings?
   [UNCERTAIN] - Need to know if client has other emergency funds
   [ASSUMPTION] Client has separate emergency fund

5. Recommendation:
   - 90% ($9K) in diversified index funds
   - 10% ($1K) in high-yield savings for immediate liquidity
   [LIKELY] This balances growth with accessibility
</reasoning>

<recommendation>
Invest $9,000 in low-cost index funds (like S&P 500 or total market fund)
Keep $1,000 in high-yield savings for immediate access
Rationale: Maximizes long-term growth while maintaining moderate risk profile
[CONFIDENT] on strategy, [ASSUMPTION] client has separate emergency fund
</recommendation>
</example>

<new_client_scenario>
Client: 55 years old, $120K annual income, $50K to invest, low risk tolerance, 10-year time horizon (planning for retirement)
Options: High-yield savings (2% return), Bond funds (4% return), Index funds (8% avg return), Real estate crowdfunding (10% potential, moderate-high risk)
</new_client_scenario>

<your_analysis>

Implement conditional reasoning within prompts to handle different scenarios:

```xml
<role>
You are a customer support supervisor routing tickets to appropriate teams.
</role>

<instructions>
Analyze the customer support ticket and respond appropriately using this decision framework:

IF issue_type = "technical" AND severity = "high":
  → Escalate immediately to Level 2 support
  → Provide emergency contact information
  → Set follow-up within 2 hours
  → Notify on-call engineer

ELSE IF issue_type = "technical" AND severity = "medium":
  → Provide detailed troubleshooting steps
  → Schedule follow-up within 24 hours
  → Offer alternative solutions

```xml
<role>
You are a senior software architect conducting system architecture review.
</role>

<instructions>

For each component, drill down into sub-components until you reach atomic units.
Then synthesize findings back up the hierarchy.

Use this recursive pattern:
</instructions>

<recursive_analysis_pattern>
FOR EACH COMPONENT:
  1. IDENTIFY primary function and responsibilities
  2. ANALYZE dependencies and interfaces
  3. EVALUATE performance and scalability characteristics
  4. ASSESS security and reliability concerns
  
  5. IF component has sub-components:
       → RECURSE: Apply this analysis to each sub-component
       → AGGREGATE findings to parent component level
       → IDENTIFY cross-cutting concerns
  
  6. SYNTHESIZE:
       → Component-level assessment
       → How sub-component issues affect this component
       → Recommendations for improvement

  7. MARK confidence levels:
       → [CONFIDENT] for clear architectural issues
       → [LIKELY] for suspected problems needing validation
       → [UNCERTAIN] for areas requiring deeper investigation

## 🔄 Self-Correction and Validation Logic

### Built-in Validation Frameworks

Implement self-checking mechanisms within prompts:

```xml
<role>
You are a senior data analyst solving business problems with quantitative analysis.
</role>

<instructions>
Solve the problem using this validation framework:

1. UNDERSTAND: Restate the problem in your own words
2. APPROACH: Identify the methodology and formulas needed
3. EXECUTE: Perform calculations step-by-step
4. VALIDATE: Check your work using multiple methods
5. VERIFY: Test edge cases and reasonableness
6. IF validation fails: Identify errors, correct, and retry

Use [CONFIDENT], [CHECKING], [CORRECTED] markers throughout.
</instructions>

<problem>
Our SaaS company has these metrics:
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR): $450,000
- Customer count: 300
- Monthly churn rate: 5%
- Average new customers per month: 25
- Average Revenue Per Account (ARPA): $1,500

Question: What will our MRR be in 6 months if these trends continue?
Provide detailed calculation with validation.
</problem>

<solution_framework>
<step_1_understanding>
[Restate what we're calculating and what information we have]
[Note any [ASSUMPTIONS] we need to make]
</step_1_understanding>

<step_2_approach>
[Identify the methodology]
[What formulas/calculations needed]
[What factors to consider]
</step_2_approach>

<step_3_execution>
[Perform month-by-month calculations]
[Show all work explicitly]

Month 0 (Current):
- Customers: 300
- MRR: $450,000
- ARPA: $1,500
[CONFIDENT] Starting point is clear

Month 1:
- Lost customers: 300 × 0.05 = 15 customers
- New customers: 25 customers
- Net change: 25 - 15 = +10 customers
- Ending customers: 310 customers
[ASSUMPTION] New customers have same $1,500 ARPA
- MRR: 310 × $1,500 = $465,000
[CONFIDENT] Math is straightforward

[Continue for months 2-6...]

Month 6:
- Customers: [calculated]
- MRR: [calculated]
</step_3_execution>

<step_4_validation>
<validation_method_1_recalculation>
[Recalculate using different method or formula]
[Cross-check numbers]
</validation_method_1_recalculation>

<validation_method_2_formula_check>
[Use compound growth formula to verify]
Growth rate = (New customers - Churned customers) / Total customers
= (25 - 15) / 300 = 3.33% per month

Expected MRR after 6 months = $450,000 × (1.0333)^6
= $450,000 × 1.219
= $548,550

[CHECKING] Does this match my month-by-month calculation?
[If yes: CONFIDENT] [If no: Need to find error]
</validation_method_2_formula_check>

<validation_method_3_reasonableness>
[Does the answer make intuitive sense?]
- Starting MRR: $450,000
- Growth rate: ~3.33% per month
- After 6 months: ~20% growth seems reasonable
- Final MRR: ~$540,000-$550,000 range makes sense
[CONFIDENT] Answer passes reasonableness test
</validation_method_3_reasonableness>
</step_4_validation>

<step_5_edge_cases>
<edge_case_1>
What if churn rate applies to MRR instead of customer count?
[Test this interpretation]
[Compare results]
[Determine which interpretation is correct based on problem statement]
</edge_case_1>

<edge_case_2>
What if new customers have lower ARPA (common for new customers)?
[ASSUMPTION] We assumed $1,500 ARPA for new customers
[SENSITIVITY] If new customer ARPA is $1,000:
[Recalculate and show impact]
</edge_case_2>
</step_5_edge_cases>

<step_6_final_answer>
<answer>
MRR in 6 months: $548,550
[CONFIDENT] in the mathematics
[ASSUMPTION] New customers have same ARPA as existing
[ASSUMPTION] Churn and growth rates remain constant
</answer>

<confidence_breakdown>
[CONFIDENT] Mathematical calculations are correct (validated 3 ways)
[LIKELY] Assumptions about constant rates are reasonable for 6-month forecast
[UNCERTAIN] Real-world factors that could affect accuracy:
  - Seasonal variations
  - Market changes
  - New customer ARPA may differ
  - Churn rate may change with customer base growth
</confidence_breakdown>

<recommendation>
Use $548,550 as the baseline forecast.
Create sensitivity scenarios:
- Best case (lower churn): $570,000
- Worst case (higher churn): $520,000
Monitor actual vs. forecast monthly and adjust.
</recommendation>
</step_6_final_answer>
</solution_framework>

### Error Detection and Recovery

Implement error handling within reasoning frameworks:

```xml
<role>
You are a senior software engineer conducting code review for bug detection and fixing.
</role>

<instructions>
Analyze code using this systematic error detection process:

1. SCAN: Look for syntax errors and obvious bugs
2. TRACE: Follow logic flow to find logical errors
3. TEST: Mentally execute code with sample inputs
4. VALIDATE: Check against requirements
5. IF errors found:
   - Categorize error type and severity
   - Explain why it's wrong
   - Provide corrected code
   - Explain the fix
6. IF no errors found:
   - Confirm code correctness
   - Suggest improvements
   - Validate against best practices

Use [BUG FOUND], [FIXED], [VALIDATED] markers.
</instructions>

<code_to_analyze>
```python
def calculate_discount(price, customer_type, items_count):
    """Calculate discount for customer purchase"""
    
    # Regular customers get 10% off
    if customer_type = "regular":
        discount = price * 0.10
    
    # VIP customers get 20% off
    elif customer_type == "vip":
        discount = price * 0.20
    
    # Bulk orders (>10 items) get additional 5% off
    if items_count > 10:
        discount = discount + (price * 0.05)
    
    final_price = price - discount
    
    return final_price

# Test the function
result = calculate_discount(100, "regular", 15)
print(f"Final price: ${result}")
```
</code_to_analyze>

<requirements>
- Regular customers: 10% discount
- VIP customers: 20% discount  
- Bulk orders (>10 items): Additional 5% discount
- Discounts should be cumulative
- Price should never be negative
- Must handle invalid customer types
</requirements>

<error_analysis>
<scan_syntax_errors>
[CHECKING] Looking for syntax errors...

[BUG FOUND] Line 5: Syntax Error
Error: `if customer_type = "regular":`
Issue: Using assignment operator (=) instead of comparison operator (==)
Severity: CRITICAL - Code will not run
Fix: Change = to ==

```python
if customer_type == "regular":  # [FIXED]
```

[VALIDATED] No other syntax errors found
</scan_syntax_errors>

<trace_logic_errors>
[CHECKING] Tracing logic flow...

[BUG FOUND] Line 14: Logic Error
Error: `discount = discount + (price * 0.05)`
Issue: For bulk orders, this adds 5% of ORIGINAL price, not current discounted price
Current behavior: 10% + 5% = 15% for regular customer with bulk order
Expected behavior: Should be cumulative (10% off first, then 5% off the reduced price)

Severity: HIGH - Incorrect discount calculation
Impact: Company loses money on bulk orders

Trace with example (price=$100, regular customer, 15 items):
- Line 6: discount = 100 * 0.10 = $10
- Line 14: discount = 10 + (100 * 0.05) = $15
- Line 16: final_price = 100 - 15 = $85
- Actual discount given: 15%

Expected behavior:
- Step 1: Apply 10% discount: $100 - $10 = $90
- Step 2: Apply 5% bulk discount on new price: $90 * 0.05 = $4.50
- Final price: $90 - $4.50 = $85.50
- Total discount: $14.50 (14.5%)

[ASSUMPTION] Based on "cumulative" in requirements, discounts should stack on reduced prices

Fix:
```python
if items_count > 10:
    additional_discount = (price - discount) * 0.05  # [FIXED]
    discount = discount + additional_discount
```

[VALIDATED] Logic flow now correct
</trace_logic_errors>

<test_edge_cases>
[CHECKING] Testing edge cases mentally...

[BUG FOUND] Missing Error Handling
Error: No handling for invalid customer_type
Test case: `calculate_discount(100, "invalid", 5)`
Current behavior: discount variable never gets initialized
Result: UnboundLocalError when trying to calculate final_price

Severity: HIGH - Runtime error crashes function
Fix: Add default case and validation

```python
def calculate_discount(price, customer_type, items_count):
    """Calculate discount for customer purchase"""
    
    # [FIXED] Validate inputs
    if price < 0:
        raise ValueError("Price cannot be negative")
    if items_count < 0:
        raise ValueError("Items count cannot be negative")
    
    # Initialize discount
    discount = 0  # [FIXED] Default value
    
    # Regular customers get 10% off
    if customer_type == "regular":
        discount = price * 0.10
    
    # VIP customers get 20% off
    elif customer_type == "vip":
        discount = price * 0.20
    
    # [FIXED] Handle invalid customer type
    elif customer_type != "guest":
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid customer type: {customer_type}")
    
    # Bulk orders (>10 items) get additional 5% off
    if items_count > 10:
        additional_discount = (price - discount) * 0.05
        discount = discount + additional_discount
    
    final_price = price - discount
    
    # [FIXED] Ensure price never negative
    if final_price < 0:
        final_price = 0
    
    return final_price
```

[VALIDATED] Edge cases now handled
</test_edge_cases>

<validate_requirements>
[CHECKING] Validating against requirements...

✓ [VALIDATED] Regular customers: 10% discount - Correct
✓ [VALIDATED] VIP customers: 20% discount - Correct  
✓ [VALIDATED] Bulk orders: Additional 5% discount - Fixed

Let me think through this step-by-step:

Step 1: [First reasoning step with explicit logic]
[CONFIDENT] or [ASSUMPTION] marker

Step 2: [Second reasoning step building on Step 1]
[Include any uncertainties]

Step 3: [Third reasoning step]
[Validation check]

### Truth Optimization Engine Enhancement

Advanced logic building significantly enhances the [TOE methodology](Pineapple_Lab_TOE_Context_Engineering_for_Agents.md):

```xml
<truth_optimization_framework>
<reasoning_transparency>
Let me work through this systematically using step-by-step reasoning:

STEP 1: Understanding the Request
[Clear interpretation of what's being asked]
[Mark any ambiguities with [UNCERTAIN]]

STEP 2: Assessing My Knowledge
What I know [CONFIDENT]ly:
- [Item 1]
- [Item 2]

What I'm [UNCERTAIN] about:
- [Item 1 - why uncertain]
- [Item 2 - what info would help]

STEP 3: Identifying Assumptions
[ASSUMPTION] I'm assuming [X] because [reasoning]
[ASSUMPTION] I'm assuming [Y] because [reasoning]

STEP 4: Considering Limitations
[LIMITATION] This approach has limitations:
- [Limitation 1 - when it matters]
- [Limitation 2 - alternatives to consider]

STEP 5: Providing Solution
[Solution with confidence markers throughout]
[Explicit reasoning for each recommendation]
</reasoning_transparency>

<confidence_assessment>
IF my_knowledge_confidence >= 90%:
  → Mark as [CONFIDENT]
  → Provide direct answer with supporting reasoning
  → Note any minor caveats

ELSE IF my_knowledge_confidence >= 70%:
  → Mark as [LIKELY]
  → Provide answer with uncertainty boundaries

## 🎯 When to Use Advanced Logic Building

### Best Use Cases:

✅ **Multi-step problem solving** - Complex analysis requiring sequential reasoning
✅ **Decision-making systems** - When clear decision trees and conditions matter
✅ **Code generation and review** - Systematic validation and error checking
✅ **Financial analysis** - Calculations requiring validation and sensitivity analysis
✅ **Diagnostic tasks** - Medical, technical, or business diagnostics
✅ **Quality assurance** - When output accuracy is critical
✅ **Production AI systems** - Where reliability and transparency are essential

### When Simpler Approaches Work:

⚠️ **Simple factual questions** - "What is X?" doesn't need elaborate logic
⚠️ **Creative tasks** - Brainstorming and ideation may not need rigid structure
⚠️ **Exploratory research** - Early-stage exploration before you know the structure

**Pro Tip:** Start simple, add complexity only when accuracy and reliability matter.
