- **Assumption Transparency**: Making AI assumptions explicit
- **Limitation Disclosure**: Honest about what AI can't do
- **Honest Reporting Framework**: Structured honesty in responses
- **Validation Requirements**: Built-in self-checking mechanisms
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
### **Truth Optimization Engine (TOE)**

A systematic framework for encouraging AI honesty and reliability:

**What it is:** A collection of prompt engineering techniques that encourage models to express uncertainty, state assumptions, and acknowledge limitations. These techniques build on AI safety research and standard software documentation practices.

**Where it comes from:**
- Model calibration research (Guo et al., 2017)
- Anthropic's work on AI honesty
- Standard software documentation best practices
- My testing and organization into a coherent framework

**What I've observed:** In my experience building AI agents for Pineapple Lab products, applying these structured approaches has significantly reduced instances where AI generates non-functional code or makes overconfident claims. I haven't conducted formal benchmarking, so I can't provide quantitative metrics yet.

**Core Techniques:**
- **Explicit Uncertainty Acknowledgment**: `[CONFIDENT]`, `[LIKELY]`, `[UNCERTAIN]` markers
- **Assumption Transparency**: Making AI assumptions explicit
- **Limitation Disclosure**: Honest about what AI can't do
- **Honest Reporting Framework**: Structured honesty in responses

## üß¨ A Note from David

I'm David Edwards, founder of Pineapple Lab in South Africa. I'm building AI-powered products (RITA, OS Brick) and learning as I go.

**My background:** I'm not a PhD researcher or AI scientist. I'm an engineer and entrepreneur who's spent the last few years building with LLMs and learning from the brilliant work of teams at Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and academic researchers.

**What this project is:** This is my personal knowledge base made public. It's how I organize what I've learned from official documentation, research papers, and hundreds of hours of trial and error.

**The recent additions:**
- **Starting Guide** - Makes prompt engineering accessible by distilling complex docs
- **XML Tag Structuring** - Anthropic's technique with my practical examples
- **Advanced Logic Building** - Wei & Kojima's research applied to production
- **Truth Optimization Engine** - My framework synthesizing AI safety practices

These aren't just theoretical ‚Äî they're techniques I use daily building real products. I'm sharing this because when I started, I wished someone had organized all this in one place. Now I'm that someone for the next person.

**Feedback welcome:** If you spot errors, have suggestions, or want to share your own patterns, please contribute. This is a living document, not a finished product.

## Framework Overview

This document describes three interconnected AI verification approaches I've developed and tested while building production AI systems:

**Context:** These are practitioner frameworks based on my experience, not formal research studies. They build on established techniques from AI safety research, software engineering, and official AI lab documentation.

These frameworks address a fundamental problem: **How do we ensure AI generates code that actually works in production?**

The three core systems:
```

**Line 69:** Current:
```markdown
**Result**: 85% reduction in false claims about functionality.
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**My Observation:** In my experience building AI agents for Pineapple Lab, I've observed significant reduction in cases where AI makes overconfident claims without basis. I haven't conducted formal benchmarking with controlled conditions, so I can't provide quantitative metrics, but the qualitative improvement has been substantial.
```

**Line 104:** Current:
```markdown
**Result**: 70% improvement in identifying potential failure points.
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**My Observation:** Assumption transparency has noticeably improved my ability to identify potential failure points before they become issues in production. Formal quantification would require controlled testing.
```

**Line 136:** Current:
```markdown
**Result**: 60% reduction in overconfident responses.
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**My Observation:** Encouraging limitation disclosure has substantially reduced overconfident responses in my work. Proper measurement would require formal benchmarking methodology.
```

**Line 180:** Current:
```markdown
**Result**: 90% improvement in response accuracy.
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**My Observation:** Structured response formats have dramatically improved response accuracy in my experience. This needs formal validation with proper metrics.
```

**Line 228:** Current:
```markdown
**Result**: 95% improvement in code functionality.
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**My Observation:** Requiring unit tests has been the single most effective technique for ensuring code functionality in my work. Almost all code generated with test requirements actually works as intended, compared to frequent failures without this requirement.
```

**Line 273:** Current:
```markdown
**Result**: 80% improvement in production readiness.
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
**My Observation:** Benchmark validation requirements have significantly improved production readiness of generated code.
```

**Lines 316-323:** Current:
```markdown
### Research Results

- **Code Functionality**: 95% of generated code actually works as intended
- **Test Quality**: 90% of generated tests provide meaningful coverage
- **Error Handling**: 85% improvement in proper error handling
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
### Observed Outcomes (Informal)

**Important Caveat:** These are my informal observations from building Pineapple Lab products, not results from controlled experiments. Proper validation would require:
- Formal methodology
- Large sample sizes (1000+ prompts)
- Blind evaluation by multiple raters
- Statistical significance testing
- Peer review

**My Informal Observations:**
- **Confidence Correlation:** Stated confidence levels generally match actual outcomes in my experience
- **Code Functionality:** Most code generated with TOE techniques works as intended
- **Test Quality:** Tests generated with explicit requirements tend to be more meaningful
- **Error Handling:** Substantial improvement in proper error handling when explicitly required

**Status:** These observations need formal research to validate. If you're interested in conducting rigorous testing, let's collaborate.
```

**Lines 453-462:** Current:
```markdown
### Research Results

- **SWE-Bench Success Rate**: 64% on real GitHub issues
- **AgentBench Accuracy**: 78% on multi-agent tasks
- **Commit0 Success Rate**: 82% on code generation
- **CI Build Repair**: 54% on build failure resolution
- **Iterative Improvement**: 15% improvement per iteration cycle
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
### Performance Notes

**Important:** I'm referencing benchmark systems (SWE-Bench, AgentBench, Commit0) that exist in the research community. I haven't personally run these benchmarks on my systems yet. This is on my roadmap for formal validation.

**These are examples of benchmarks I plan to test against**, not results I've achieved:
- SWE-Bench: Real GitHub issues for testing code fixes
- AgentBench: Multi-agent task scenarios
- Commit0: Code generation benchmarks
- CI Build Repair: Build failure resolution

**Current Status:** I use these informally for development. Formal benchmarking with proper methodology is planned for 2025 Q2.
```

**Lines 807-813:** Current:
```markdown
### Research Results

- **Combined Effectiveness**: 40% improvement over individual systems
- **Error Reduction**: 60% reduction in context-related errors
- **Quality Improvement**: 35% improvement in overall code quality
- **Efficiency Gain**: 50% reduction in iteration cycles
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
### My Observations (Informal)

**Important Caveat:** These are informal observations from my work, not scientifically validated results.

**What I've Observed:**
- Systems work better together than separately
- Context-related errors are noticeably reduced
- Overall code quality improves substantially
- Development iteration cycles are faster

**What This Needs:** Formal research methodology, proper metrics, controlled testing, and peer review to validate.

The research shows that **AI can be made reliable and trustworthy**...

**Research Team**: Friday Unified Development Team  
**Date**: January 2025  
```

**Change to:**
```markdown
## Conclusion

This framework demonstrates that **AI verification is achievable** through systematic approaches:

1. **Honesty is Engineerable**: Prompt engineering can encourage AI to be more honest about capabilities
2. **Testing is Essential**: Benchmarking proves code works in real scenarios
3. **Context Management Works**: Memory systems enable work on large codebases
4. **Integration Matters**: Systems work better together

**What This Proves:**
Through practical application in production systems, these techniques improve AI reliability and trustworthiness.

**What This Doesn't Prove:**
Without formal research, I can't make quantitative claims or scientific conclusions. This is practitioner knowledge, not peer-reviewed science.

**What I Hope:**
This framework saves you time and provides a starting point for your work. If you build on this, please share your findings.
